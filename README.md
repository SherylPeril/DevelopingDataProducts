# DevelopingDataProducts -- Shinyapps upload problem

To my reviewers, I did complete this project and the result is shown in the Pitch that I uploaded for the second half of the project.  Unfortunately, I had an idea for improving it and did do so, but when I tried to upload the improvement shinyapps.io website had reached capacity and corrupted the app that had already been uploaded but couldn't accept the new app.  I will also attach some screenshots so you can see what it looked like.

I put a lot of work into this so am hoping to still get some credit for this effort!  It appears that the problem with shinyapps.io is beyond my control.  Thanks.
